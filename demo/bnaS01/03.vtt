Good morning, Mr. Gem!

11
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.211
Nice weather, isn't it?

12
00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.923
How is that room? It's way better than the rooftop, is it not?

13
00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.551
Yeah! Thanks!

14
00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:01.306
Mr. Gem, what's that big building over there?

15
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.808
Hm? Ah, it's the Medical Center.

16
00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.561
SYLVASTA Medical Center.

17
00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:11.065
It's under direct management of SYLVASTA Pharmaceutics.
There's a laboratory and a hospital there.

18
00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.276
SYLVASTA's...

19
00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:17.030
I see... If I go there, I could ask about my disease...

20
00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.334
H... Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

21
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.002
You little... It won't open!

22
00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.254
Why? Hey, hang on, what is this?!

23
00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.090
Why?! Let me out! Hey!!

24
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.091
Be quiet.

25
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.093
Why?! It won't open...

26
00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.096
I finally understand that you were a human.

27
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.389
So what?

28
00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:45.266
Your existence is dangerous.

29
00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.268
Huh? Why do you say that?

30
00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:51.731
People would panic if they found out that a human can turn into a beastman.

31
00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:55.944
Don't go out until we find out the details. I'll be bringing you food.

32
00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.030
W-What are you talking about?! I really don't get you!

33
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.492
Believe in me. I'll protect the peace of the beastmen.

34
00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:05.536
No, even if you say it all cool like that, I can't trust you!

35
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.413
It's gross!

36
00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:11.334
Open up...! I'm going to the hospital...!

37
00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.710
No.

38
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.464
One step outside and I'll kill you.

39
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.550
S-So you don't care about <i>my</i> peace?

40
00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.807
Remodelling this early in the morning? Must be tough.

41
00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.642
Mayor.

42
00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:31.145
It's... the Mayor?

43
00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:33.690
The bomber?
<i>Yes.</i>

44
00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.275
We received a report...

45
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.821
...from the police saying the Medical Center received a threatening letter.

46
00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.072
And earlier this morning...

47
00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:44.325
A truck loaded with SYLVASTA medicine was blown up.

48
00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.035
A bomb?

49
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.831
Uh... It's my ears this time? Oh well.

50
00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.250
"If you have the money to make..."

51
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.752
"...a beastmen hospital and use the latest equipment..."

52
00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:58.923
"...use it for the sake of humans" is what the culprit said.

53
00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:01.050
So it's those anti-beastmen again.

54
00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.595
The police also tried to track the smell of the bombs, but...

55
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.849
...because of the impact, the smell was severely muddy...

56
00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.143
...so they couldn't follow any trails.

57
00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:13.062
Your excellent sense of smell is way more...

58
00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:15.648
reliable than the police investigation team.

59
00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:18.901
I beg you. Look for the bombs.

60
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.071
There are people admitted to the Medical Center.

61
00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:23.239
We must avoid a fight.

62
00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:28.911
If the hospital is blown up... I might not be able to recover from my disease!

63
00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.496
That's bad... Really bad!

64
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.752
Help me, Mayor!

65
00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.087
That was a voice just now.
<i>Nope.</i>

66
00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:44.218
Help me! He trapped me here!

67
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.932
It's Kuro. He recently remembered how to mimic.

68
00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.563
Move that.

69
00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.026
Oogami?

70
00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:04.489
Mayor! This guy is responsible for abducting a woman!

71
00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:05.364
Hey!

72
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.035
He said he'd kill me if I went outside! That's blackmail!

73
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.954
It's for your sake and beastmen's sake.

74
00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:15.416
You're Michiru Kagemori.

75
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.919
Just looking at you, you're a splendid beastman!

76
00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:21.172
It's hard to believe you were a human until just recently.

77
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.508
So... you knew?

78
00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.469
I have to know everything about Animacity.

79
00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:28.179
That's the mayor's duty.

80
00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:31.140
I see. It was Gran Grandma.

81
00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:34.185
Confidentiality is also part of my duties.

82
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.394
Excuse me...

83
00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:39.357
Let me help with searching for the bombs.

84
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.525
Why?

85
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.112
They have the latest technology in the SYLVASTA Center, right?

86
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:48.116
If that's the case, they might be able to cure my disease, right?

87
00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.409
We don't know if it's a disease yet.

88
00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:52.954
But it's true she used to be a human.

89
00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:55.665
The chances of it being a disease aren't zero.

90
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.626
In any case, letting her outside is dangerous.

91
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:02.797
If anti-beastmen humans find out about her... Who knows what would happen?

92
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.258
I don't want to stay put.

93
00:07:05.716 --> 00:07:09.554
All I did before coming here was hide and do nothing.

94
00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.848
Holing up in my room...

95
00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.600
When I ran away, I kept hiding from the beastmen hunters...

96
00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:16.936
...and I finally made it into this town...

97
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:20.481
..but living in the shadows again... I refuse to do that.

98
00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.524
Look...

99
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:28.656
We need more people. Let's let her help.

100
00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:31.492
You can take care of being Kuro's contact, right?

101
00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.579
Contact?

102
00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:38.207
You can't tell she was a human just by looking at her.

103
00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:41.878
As long as she moves within Animacity, there shouldn't be a problem.

104
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:46.215
However, the fact that you were a human stays here.

105
00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.592
Got it.

106
00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:51.304
Would you also let me drop the charges against keeping you in captivity?

107
00:07:52.513 --> 00:07:54.015
...Okay.

108
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.308
Okay, here.

109
00:07:55.766 --> 00:07:58.811
A phone! It's been so long!

110
00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:01.981
If Kuro finds something, contact Oogami.

111
00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:05.610
These are bomb fragments left on the scene.

112
00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:11.949
SYLVASTA Pharmaceutics is part of a world-leading...

113
00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:13.951
company group, the SYLVASTA Conglomerate.

114
00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:19.665
The mayor says humans have the same rights as beastmen...

115
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.543
So Animacity can get big fundings.

116
00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:24.962
There are lots of humans who dislike that.

117
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:27.840
There are rumors that SYLVASTA Pharmaceutics...

118
00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:30.718
..is collecting beastmen data and making a profit off of it.

119
00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.846
Not all beastmen are welcome there.

120
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.225
So why did you take the job?

121
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.017
Huh?

122
00:08:38.142 --> 00:08:41.770
I thought you didn't move if it wasn't for beastmen's sake.

123
00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:44.815
I can't refuse a request from the Mayor.

124
00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:07.129
It's Oogami. I located the bombs.

125
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:11.634
There are six bombs. Let the bomb squad go look.

126
00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.344
You go to the Medical Center.

127
00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:14.762
The Medical Center too?

128
00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:18.724
No, there are no bomb smells there, but just to be sure.

129
00:09:19.016 --> 00:09:22.395
The real target of the bombers must be the Medical Center, after all.

130
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.897
Hold on, I'm going too!

131
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.441
There are 6 bombs.

132
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.609
Let's hurry up.

133
00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.716
Huh... Kuro?

134
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:53.843
Ah, h-hold on!

135
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.854
Hurry up!

136
00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.397
Don't fret.

137
00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:10.401
The police are too busy dealing with the bombs.

138
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:12.987
In any case, this is the last time!

139
00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:17.617
That's cold. You should see this as a good thing!

140
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:21.579
A good thing? What are they up to?

141
00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:28.336
Hey! Who's eavesdropping over there?!

142
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.879
Ah, damn it!

143
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.340
Who is it? Come out!

144
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.095
Heh. Capture her.

145
00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:43.309
She saw us! She might've heard something.

146
00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:46.896
Ya think we'd let a child like that run away?

147
00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:51.859
However, I swear I've seen her before...

148
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.821
Come on, pick up!

149
00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.493
Alright, that's the last one.

150
00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:09.085
It's her!
<i>Her?</i>

151
00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.757
...! That's...!

152
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.468
I knew it! It's her!

153
00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:19.428
Yeah...

154
00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:25.893
Hey, kid. Why were you in such a place?

155
00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:29.522
Uh... I got a bit lost...

156
00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:33.234
Oh? Did you happen to hear something important?

157
00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.780
Gotta teach a good ol' lesson...

158
00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:39.865
...to annoying kids like you.

159
00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:45.871
Stop that.

160
00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:47.373
Y... You're Oogami!

161
00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:50.292
You bastard!
<i>Die!</i>

162
00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:58.008
Go. I won't kill you. Not today, that is.

163
00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:00.970
Ngh... We'll remember this!

164
00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:04.557
Thank god I made it. Kuro let me know.

165
00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:06.934
Damn it! I called you multiple times!

166
00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:10.396
I'm sorry. Why were those guys chasing you?

167
00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:15.901
So, I saw those shady guys sneaking in some luggage through the back of the Medical Center...

168
00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.987
Who are they?

169
00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:20.656
A gang.
<i>A gang?</i>

170
00:12:20.781 --> 00:12:24.368
They were sneaking in some goods in cooperation with the staff...

171
00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:27.997
An explosion?!

172
00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:32.251
You wait in the association!

173
00:12:32.376 --> 00:12:34.962
No way! If they blow it up I'll be in serious trouble!

174
00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:36.422
It's dangerous!

175
00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.674
Okay, I'll admit it then.

176
00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:44.346
I was really a human... But right now, I'm a beastman.

177
00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:46.307
What are you saying?

178
00:12:46.974 --> 00:12:49.518
You'll protect all beastmen, right?

179
00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:52.771
Then protect me, too.

180
00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:56.484
Because I'm also a beastman.

181
00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.987
...You're persuasive.

182
00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:10.289
This is horrible.

183
00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.666
Oh, Oogami.

184
00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:15.794
This is the Medical Center Chief, Mr. Yaba.

185
00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:19.673
This is also the handiwork of those bombers, huh.

186
00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:23.886
The police is responsible for this, you weren't able to stop it!

187
00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.263
Let me investigate.

188
00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:30.392
He's an advisor who's helping with the investigation.

189
00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:31.852
Is that alright?

190
00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.646
Hm. Feel free.

191
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:42.154
Oogami overlooking this, though...

192
00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:47.993
I efficiently tracked the bombs' smells, so why...

193
00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:00.881
This is...

194
00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:04.218
Did you figure something out?

195
00:14:04.718 --> 00:14:07.096
There's no smell.

196
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.392
Mimura, it's that girl! She came back!

197
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:13.018
What?

198
00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:15.729
If that's the case...
<i>I got it.</i>

199
00:14:20.317 --> 00:14:21.944
P... President...

200
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:24.572
The Medical Center was blown up?

201
00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:25.948
What a scary world.

202
00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:30.286
Yes. The research data management section was blown up.

203
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:35.249
However, the hospital's data management is hosted in another building, so it's safe.

204
00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:37.209
I see. That's a relief.

205
00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:42.423
<i>Restoring the place of the explosion is first priority. Do it at any cost.</i>

206
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:45.676
<i>Make sure not to leave any traces of an incident.</i>

207
00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:49.054
<i>Not a trace, Mr. Yaba.</i>

208
00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:50.890
<i>...Understood.</i>

209
00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:54.852
<i>What a pain.</i>

210
00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:57.813
Chief Yaba.

211
00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.900
Can we make some questions?

212
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:02.484
What do you want?

213
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.863
I'll make sure you take responsibility for this!

214
00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:09.199
We investigated the place of the incident...

215
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:12.328
We couldn't confirm any traces of the culprit.

216
00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:14.079
Are you avoiding me?!

217
00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:15.873
It's not just the culprit.

218
00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:18.375
There wasn't a single smell at the scene.

219
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.835
That's impossible.

220
00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:24.131
It's impossible to have all smell disappear under normal circumstances.

221
00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:28.218
You have to use a chemical to do such a thing, after all.

222
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.347
Mr. Yaba... In this laboratory...

223
00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:33.974
You're able to create such a thing, isn't that right?

224
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:35.559
That's ridiculous.

225
00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:38.604
Are you doubting me to hide your own incompetence?!

226
00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:42.608
I saw the staff here cooperating with a gang earlier.

227
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.319
Doesn't that mean you're involved as well?

228
00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:49.823
You had bombers blow up the lab to erase the evidence...

229
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.285
Hey, hey... Do you really trust what this guy's saying?!

230
00:15:57.414 --> 00:16:02.044
You can always reach the culprit if you follow the residual smell left on the scene.

231
00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:06.382
Because there are no smell-less beastmen.

232
00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:08.467
But at the crime scene...

233
00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:12.096
There was a period where there were absolutely no traces of any smell.

234
00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:17.309
...And your hands are lacking any smell right now.

235
00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:20.479
Ever since the lab was blown up.

236
00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:31.115
His smelling skills are adopted as evidence under the provisions of the Special Beastman Territory.

237
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:36.870
Mr. Yaba, can we have a chat at the station?

238
00:16:43.627 --> 00:16:45.629
Shirou!

239
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:46.922
Don't move!

240
00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:49.299
If you move, I'll strangle this kid to death!

241
00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:55.305
Run, Mimura!

242
00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:59.685
Chase him!

243
00:17:11.696 --> 00:17:14.366
Your claws won't tear through my skin!

244
00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:18.078
You're covering up the case for your own benefit.

245
00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:21.330
My bare hands are enough for such a cowardly man!

246
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.675
To you who abandoned the pride of a beastman...

247
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.761
...that horn is useless!

248
00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:37.890
Stop it. I beg you! My horn... Anything but my horn...!

249
00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:47.900
Let that kid go!

250
00:17:48.275 --> 00:17:49.359
Don't move!

251
00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:51.862
If you so much as move an inch, I'm dropping this kid!

252
00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:55.032
You can't escape if you do things like this!

253
00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:57.743
It's all your fault! If only you weren't here...

254
00:17:57.868 --> 00:18:00.079
...it wouldn't be this complicated!

255
00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:05.751
If you value this kid's life, prepare a helicopter with one hundred million yen for me to escape!

256
00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:07.252
Don't be ridiculous!

257
00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:15.094
Kuro!

258
00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:17.596
Don't underestimate a chameleon's sight!

259
00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:20.557
If you do unnecessary things, I'll really kill this kid!

260
00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:22.434
Where's the money and he helicopter?!

261
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.645
<i>This dude is serious!</i>

262
00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:31.443
<i>If I can extend my hands like before...!</i>

263
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.733
Shirou! Shirou!

264
00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.444
I'm alive.

265
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.196
Would you move?

266
00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:23.453
Oogami! It's best if you don't move.

267
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.539
Get some treatment at the Medical Center.

268
00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:27.624
No, I'm fine.

269
00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.336
Can you move?
<i>Yeah.</i>

270
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.380
Good grief.

271
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:37.009
Are you really okay?
<i>I won't die.</i>

272
00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:43.056
Uhm. Thank you for saving me.

273
00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.224
I promised.

274
00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:47.603
I'll protect all beastmen.

275
00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.733
Yaba and Mimura confessed.

276
00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:56.111
They were cooperating for embezzlement.

277
00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:58.780
Then they realized the higher-ups found out...

278
00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:01.200
...and they blew up the data system of the Medical Center.

279
00:20:01.617 --> 00:20:05.370
They hired people to set up fake bombs...

280
00:20:05.495 --> 00:20:08.874
...so they could erase the embezzlement data.

281
00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.418
Is that really all?
<i>What do you mean?</i>

282
00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:16.673
That Mimura guy's malice... It was stronger than that.

283
00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:19.301
<i>If only you weren't here...!</i>

284
00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:22.804
I mean, blowing up your own lab to protect yourself...

285
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.389
It's really odd.

286
00:20:24.514 --> 00:20:28.143
That's how they try to cover up what's inconvenient for them.

287
00:20:28.268 --> 00:20:29.603
Adults, I mean.

288
00:20:29.728 --> 00:20:32.189
Are you talking about me?
<i>Who knows~</i>

289
00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.901
I'm sorry. I won't lock you up anymore.

290
00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:40.155
I mean, you were so worked up over it...

291
00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:43.033
I don't want to be put in the same bag as those guys.

292
00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:45.869
So don't go telling anyone else about your beastman disease.

293
00:20:46.286 --> 00:20:47.454
I know.

294
00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:50.791
Ms. Michiru, I'll search for a treatment for you.

295
00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.587
She's in charge of researching beastmen genetics.

296
00:20:55.712 --> 00:20:58.048
She also has the first PhD on it.

297
00:20:58.465 --> 00:21:00.884
I'm a politician now, though.

298
00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:05.264
I have a good relationship with SYLVASTA Pharmaceutics, so it's a good chance.

299
00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:08.767
I had them make a backup for the Animacity establishment as well.

300
00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:10.686
I see.

301
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:14.898
Be careful with SYLVASTA Pharmaceutics. They're very fishy.

302
00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:15.732
Why?

303
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:19.319
No reason. Just my nose telling me that.

304
00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:22.322
Ah, it's your... "wild intuition", eh?

305
00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:25.367
Are you making fun of me?

306
00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:26.326
No waaay~

307
00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:32.040
Gentlemen!

308
00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:34.751
Our research here is over.

309
00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:36.545
Are we moving?

310
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.423
Yeah. I'm going, too.

311
00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:43.427
It's time I take a look at how the beastmen base is for myself.

312
00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:47.556
It's been ten years since Animacity was established, huh.

313
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.975
What a big milestone.
