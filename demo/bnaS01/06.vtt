Gem!

4
00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:06.858
I told you not to shower while in beast mode, your feathers clog everything up!

5
00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.360
Let me shower how I want.

6
00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:14.866
Breaking such a simple promise... Ginrou-sama is watching, you know!

7
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.077
Ginrou-sama...

8
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.288
Michiru, you don't even know about Ginrou-sama?

9
00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:22.665
I just know about him by name...

10
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.668
That won't do! Let me explain.

11
00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:31.591
Depending on the era, humans and beastmen have lived with certain distance between them...

12
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.261
...but no matter the era, beastmen have always gone through a crisis.

13
00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.515
That's when a savior appeared...

14
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.351
That's Ginrou-sama.

15
00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:47.816
A worldwide legend saying Ginrou-sama has saved us has existed for as much as a thousand years.

16
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.026
Did you draw this, Mr. Gem?

17
00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.946
I'll make a living out of this once I'm old.

18
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.906
Don't mistify her!

19
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.867
Huh? You're leaving?

20
00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.119
<i>Hey, are you listening?!</i>

21
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:00.537
Guess I'll go as well.

22
00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:03.289
Hey, you two.

23
00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:08.544
Here.

24
00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:11.256
You always give this to me, but what is it?

25
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:16.761
It's a charm for safety, to give to Ginrou-sama in case he comes to your aid.

26
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.764
I see~ Thank you!

27
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:24.936
Ah! You'll be cursed!

28
00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:30.692
There's no way there's a god that won't save people if you don't give it food.

29
00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.862
Everyone believes it, so shouldn't you be more respectful?

30
00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:36.865
That's why you have no friends.

31
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.868
You don't have any, either.

32
00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.370
I had <i>many</i> friends.

33
00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:46.875
I also had a very close friend, and she's super cute!

34
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.710
Why so proud?

35
00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:51.588
I mean, it's my pride.

36
00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.339
<i>What's your name?</i>

37
00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:54.507
<i>Nazuna!</i>

38
00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.926
<i>Even if you read it upside down...!</i>
<i>It's Nazuna!</i>

39
00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:59.053
<i>My dream is your dream!</i>

40
00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:01.931
<i>No matter how you look at it, I'm an idol in every direction!</i>

41
00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.933
<i>I'm Nazuna Hiwatashi!</i>

42
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.937
<i>That'll definitely catch on!</i>

43
00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:09.689
<i>Come on, you should audition!</i>

44
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.525
<i>I don't wanna be chosen by anyone.</i>

45
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.360
<i>I'd rather be the one choosing.</i>

46
00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:15.987
<i>Ah, you're scared.</i>

47
00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:16.821
<i>Huh?</i>

48
00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:19.657
<i>We almost died due to a single accident!</i>

49
00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.470
<i>Nothing can scare us anymore!</i>

50
00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:26.372
<i>There's a chance in adversity! Come on, you should become a real idol!</i>

51
00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:29.208
<i>H-hey... That's dangerous!</i>

52
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.420
<i>I'm not giving up on basket...</i>

53
00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:36.841
<i>...so let's make it to the top in our own fields!</i>

54
00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.594
<i>We can become anything we want!</i>

55
00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:43.640
<i>Hm... You're amazing, Michiru.</i>

56
00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:48.102
...But one day, right in front of me...

57
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:52.941
...right in front of me, she was abducted.

58
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:54.776
...wait, what?

59
00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:58.029
If you're looking for Oogami, he went to the mayor's.

60
00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.573
Here.
<i>Huh?</i>

61
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.368
It's this month's phone bill.

62
00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.912
So I pay you for that, too?

63
00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.331
If ya can't pay it, then earn it.

64
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:14.671
I'm overpricing this product to sell it to those slum fools.

65
00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:22.929
I hate it... Having to take part in a crime just to pay for my phone.

66
00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.013
<i>Michiru!</i>

67
00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:25.390
Jackie!

68
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:26.808
That's...

69
00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.851
Look at this water purifier!

70
00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:32.230
They say it can even turn muddy water into french water!

71
00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.898
I bought it with a loan!

72
00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:36.109
With a lifetime payment plan!

73
00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:37.110
Hey.

74
00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.237
Which of you is "Jackie"?

75
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.658
I told you lifetime payments were bad!

76
00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.453
I mean, when I woke up from the shopping spree dazzle...

77
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.251
It won't really matter even if I just start with you guys...

78
00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.420
...but I'll make an example out of you.

79
00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.759
Anyone who pushes the paying date even a day will be met with fire from now on.

80
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.810
Jackie! Hey, move it!

81
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.312
Jackie!

82
00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.777
Hey, what's that?

83
00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.420
Stop at once, lost beastmen.

84
00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.380
The hell are you?

85
00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.717
Beastmen hurting other beastmen...

86
00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:45.470
That's low even for humans.

87
00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.597
What the hell are you blabbering on about?

88
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.933
Those who don't pay up aren't beastmen or humans...

89
00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:55.063
They're trash! Shouldn't you take out the trash?

90
00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.190
They are not trash.

91
00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:00.318
We are all noble beastmen.

92
00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.820
You must not forget that honor.

93
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.906
Ginrou-sama is watching.

94
00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:06.532
Are you stupid?

95
00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:09.744
Ginrou is just a fairytale made up by weaklings!

96
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.164
Rejoice!

97
00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.251
We will show the silver light even to unenlightened beastmen like you!

98
00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:25.426
Silver wolf guru, Death Rube!

99
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.680
She has descended into Animacity, the capital of the beastmen!

100
00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:32.642
I don't care if you're a guru or whatever. Stay back!

101
00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:35.269
If you interfere, I'll burn you all as well!

102
00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:40.399
Jackie!

103
00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.401
Burn! Burn!

104
00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:44.821
Hot! Hot! It's hot!

105
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:48.324
My flesh is burning! What a nice smell~

106
00:06:59.293 --> 00:07:01.629
It's Ginrou!
<i>It's Ginrou-sama!</i>

107
00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:05.716
What are you all doing?! Shoot, shoot them!

108
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.555
It's no use! We can't shoot!

109
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.181
Please forgive us!

110
00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:13.933
Get it together, you two!

111
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.067
That's Ginrou...

112
00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:25.987
Ginrou-sama is the god of beastmen!

113
00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:29.157
He will erase your troubles and fears by way of the silver light!

114
00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.869
Worship our guardian deity, Ginrou-sama!

115
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:47.592
Death Rube! She is the maiden of Ginrou!

116
00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.137
The silver light be with you.

117
00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.555
Let's all shine together.

118
00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.016
Hold on, that's Nazuna!

119
00:07:55.516 --> 00:07:57.810
Heeeey, Nazuna! Nazuna!

120
00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:00.396
It's me! Look! It's... H-hold on...

121
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:04.317
What are you doing? H-hold on...!
Even if you read it upside down~?!

122
00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.409
Back down.

123
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.498
I feel great evil coming from this animal.

124
00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:21.834
You must not get close until I say otherwise.

125
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:33.095
Michiru? I knew it was you, Michiru!

126
00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.390
Why are you here? To think you also became a beastman...

127
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.768
Nazuna...

128
00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:41.687
Uh, I mean, this is...

129
00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.815
Thank god you're alive!

130
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.027
You're okay! Thank god!

131
00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.112
Michiru...

132
00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.075
A tanuki?

133
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.369
I-I'm a raccoon.

134
00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.663
For some reason, I switched a little later...

135
00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.165
I've been living here for a while...

136
00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:03.918
Death Rube!

137
00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:06.170
Come with me!

138
00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.465
Eh? H-hold on!

139
00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:17.098
Is it okay to just leave those guys be?

140
00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.558
I guess...

141
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.768
Are you...
<i>Hey.</i>

142
00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:24.730
You're a tanuki! Why'd you say you were a raccoon?

143
00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:41.497
Aah, there's no way you're a raccoon!

144
00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:46.085
I mean, you're a silver wolf, meanwhile I'm just a tanuki...

145
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.753
Hold on a sec.

146
00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.598
I'm not a silver wolf. I'm a fox.

147
00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.851
A fox? Were you transformed?

148
00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:06.063
Keep it a secret! I'll be in big trouble if anyone finds out.

149
00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.441
Okay, got it.

150
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:12.445
Michiru... Are you maybe unable to return to your human form?

151
00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:16.824
I couldn't at first, but now I can.

152
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:19.827
Well, but I mean, why are you in beast form?

153
00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:22.913
Come on. Isn't it more convenient to be like this?

154
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:27.335
I know! Come to my house! I have lots of things to tell you!

155
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.669
You live here?

156
00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.881
Yeah!
<i>Really?! Let's go then!</i>

157
00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.008
Yeah, let's go!

158
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.635
<i>The Silver Wolf Order.</i>

159
00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:41.599
They're a religious group that serve Ginrou. They search for beastmen freedom and pilgrimage through many countries.

160
00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:45.561
I heard rumors, but to think the guru is actually Ginrou...

161
00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.022
A complete beast form...

162
00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:51.984
A normal beastman shouldn't be able to accomplish that.

163
00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:54.945
Are they welcome despite that?

164
00:10:55.363 --> 00:11:00.534
"Any beastman is welcome" is this city's motto.

165
00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:03.746
You don't like it?
<i>I don't.</i>

166
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.707
Yeah. As expected.

167
00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:10.920
I was putting off meeting them to do some research on them...

168
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.924
...but I figure it'd be faster to see them directly.

169
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:18.427
So you saw me getting abducted?

170
00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:21.389
It was a bit far so I couldn't see well...

171
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:25.893
...but you disappeared just after that, so I immediately got what happened.

172
00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:29.980
I thought things like "Are they gonna murder me?". It was super scary!

173
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.274
Becoming a beastman in the first place...

174
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.068
...anyone would panic.

175
00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:35.152
Yeah, you're right.

176
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:39.615
I was taken to some sort of weird research facility...

177
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.868
...and the one who got me out of there was Boris Cliff.

178
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:46.831
He knew I had transforming abilities.

179
00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:52.044
He had me train, and after that, I joined the Silver Wolf Order.

180
00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:54.755
He made me, who can transform into Ginrou, into a guru...

181
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.550
...and he settled with being my trainer.

182
00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:02.012
Was Boris that masked guy who was with you?

183
00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.305
Yep!

184
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:06.517
Is he trustworthy? Isn't he a bit shady?

185
00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:08.102
He's not shady.

186
00:12:08.602 --> 00:12:10.729
Have you ever seen him without the mask?

187
00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:11.939
Nope.

188
00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:15.484
He's always using that mask? Isn't that kinda gross?

189
00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:17.069
It's not.

190
00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:21.449
I told you, Boris saved me from that facility.

191
00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:23.784
So he's not a bad guy.

192
00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:26.912
I see. I guess that's okay then.

193
00:12:33.794 --> 00:12:36.338
What about you? How long have you been this way?

194
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.008
Just after it happened to you, I think.

195
00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:42.052
I holed up in my house and hid for a while...

196
00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:45.014
...but I wanted to look for a way to go back to normal...

197
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.058
...and I thought I could find something by coming here.

198
00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:51.020
No one knows anything about this disease.

199
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.646
Disease?

200
00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:56.942
I think it's a disease. A beastman disease.

201
00:12:57.359 --> 00:12:59.445
A beastman disease, huh...

202
00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.325
You seem to be having a lot of fun, though.

203
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.245
What? Even like this, it's pretty rough!

204
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.914
Looks like you have lots of friends.

205
00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:13.792
Well, there are plenty of bad people here, too.

206
00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:16.921
But there are also people who come and help me out.

207
00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:18.797
I see~

208
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:24.261
Is that the mayor of Animacity?

209
00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:27.264
Yeah! I help her out sometimes.

210
00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.726
Hey!

211
00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:33.103
Let's live here together!

212
00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:36.857
Leave all that guru stuff behind.

213
00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:42.279
I promise I'll find a cure, so before we go back to being human, let's try our best together!

214
00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:45.824
Ah, he's back!

215
00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:49.662
Shirou, welcome home.
<i>Thanks.</i>

216
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:53.165
Hey, Shirou! Ms. Melissa!

217
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.584
Could you let a friend stay here as well?

218
00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:57.294
A friend?

219
00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:04.677
No way.

220
00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:06.554
What? Why?

221
00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.138
That woman can't be here.

222
00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:10.766
I'm going back.

223
00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:13.352
Ah... Wait, Nazuna!

224
00:14:13.727 --> 00:14:14.645
Hold it!

225
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.231
Is that friend of yours... a human?

226
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:21.151
That's right. Nazuna and I have the same beastman disease.

227
00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.655
Why is it okay if I'm here but Nazuna can't?

228
00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:28.701
That cult is fishy. There's definitely something else to it.

229
00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:31.078
You can't trust that woman, either.

230
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.122
What the hell...

231
00:14:33.414 --> 00:14:36.542
How about you kick me out as well?

232
00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:45.843
Excuse me!

233
00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.345
I'm Michiru Kagemori!

234
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:49.597
I want to join!

235
00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.518
Boris.

236
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.279
I saw the guru earlier this evening and I was moved by it!

237
00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.822
Please!

238
00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:08.657
Alright.

239
00:15:09.116 --> 00:15:11.702
Let Ginrou-sama guide you.

240
00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:16.457
Ugh, what's up with that? So gross.

241
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.125
Welcome, sister.

242
00:15:18.792 --> 00:15:22.004
Here. I'll guide you to your tent.

243
00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:25.591
Ah, understood! Please do!

244
00:15:27.217 --> 00:15:31.805
That mayor is always busy. She is not willing to see us.

245
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.057
Ah, I see.

246
00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:35.893
By the way, a moment ago...

247
00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:38.979
A girl by the name of Kagemori came to join us...

248
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.482
Do you know her?

249
00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:42.775
Who knows.

250
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.866
Be beautiful.

251
00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:53.452
More beautiful than a god.

252
00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:14.890
Boris told me. I can't believe you joined the Silver Wolf Order.

253
00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:17.017
Let's run away together.

254
00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:19.269
That Boris guy's grossness isn't normal!

255
00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:22.064
You can't trust a guy like that!

256
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:25.442
Michiru, you're pretty dumb.

257
00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:26.235
What?!

258
00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.654
Don't raise your voice!

259
00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:31.031
It's best if you return.

260
00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:35.661
Animacity isn't willing to welcome a cult.

261
00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:39.123
It's possible we might just have to leave.

262
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:40.207
Why?

263
00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:43.752
You're leaving too? Wouldn't you rather stay here?

264
00:16:44.044 --> 00:16:48.007
Unlike you, I have no place to be here.

265
00:16:48.298 --> 00:16:51.427
That guy said I can't be here, didn't he?

266
00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:52.594
That's...

267
00:16:53.053 --> 00:16:55.347
The mayor is also unwilling to meet.

268
00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:58.600
The mayor? You went to see her?

269
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:02.479
More like she refused to receive me.

270
00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.815
You can meet her.

271
00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:06.858
Leave it to me.

272
00:17:06.983 --> 00:17:10.194
I know she's always at a particular store in the morning.

273
00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.031
Let's go meet her together.

274
00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:16.076
I'm sure she'll understand if she just talks with you properly.

275
00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:18.871
Let's go before everyone wakes up.

276
00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:21.749
H-hey, hold on!

277
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.042
We're up early tomorrow. Go sleep!

278
00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:29.006
I'm sure it'll be okay. I can be with you like this...

279
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:39.850
Mayor Rose!

280
00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:41.310
Ms. Michiru.

281
00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:44.021
I brought a person who wanted to see you.

282
00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:47.024
I was a human...!
<i>I am the Silver Wolf Order Guru...</i>

283
00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:48.400
Death Rube.

284
00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:52.613
Thank you for making time to meet me.

285
00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:58.619
Today, I am requesting for the permanent residence for the Silver Wolf Order members in Animacity.

286
00:17:59.203 --> 00:18:01.497
Ah... Nazuna?

287
00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.707
If that's what you want to talk about...

288
00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.543
Why won't you listen to what I have to say?

289
00:18:06.668 --> 00:18:09.588
"Animacity welcomes every beastman".

290
00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:11.215
Is that pledge a lie?

291
00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:14.760
Ginrou is a sacred entity to beastmen.

292
00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:18.931
Playing with its existence is something unforgivable.

293
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:22.434
This city is open to every beastman.

294
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:27.272
But we don't need someone who deceives beastmen in this city.

295
00:18:27.397 --> 00:18:29.191
No, that's...!

296
00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:31.485
It's true that I am a human.

297
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.112
I'm not the legendary Ginrou.

298
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.905
As expected.

299
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.867
But does Ginrou exist in the first place?

300
00:18:38.992 --> 00:18:42.079
An immortal wolf beastman living for more than a thousand years...

301
00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:45.332
He's a beastman, but he takes the form of a wolf.

302
00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.459
There's no way there's someone like that.

303
00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:53.715
But by having them hold onto that fictitious existence, you can keep beastmen in check.

304
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:56.885
They were looking for salvation. Am I wrong?

305
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.348
That's why I'm making that lie a reality.

306
00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:03.308
For the sake of beastmen's happiness.

307
00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:05.936
I'm not fabricating hope.

308
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:08.647
We are instilling hope into them.

309
00:19:08.772 --> 00:19:12.192
Animacity must be needing that very hope.

310
00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:14.903
Isn't that right, Mayor Rose Barbarei?

311
00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:16.989
Nazuna...

312
00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:22.786
Your friend is very interesting.

313
00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:27.416
Come to the city hall this afternoon. We'll begin the settlement procedures.

314
00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:29.418
Understood.

315
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:38.343
Hmm! What a nice morning~

316
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.679
I'm hungry.

317
00:19:40.804 --> 00:19:41.555
Come on...

318
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:43.390
What?

319
00:19:43.807 --> 00:19:47.936
I should be the one saying "what"! You deceived me! What's with that attitude?!

320
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:49.229
I deceived you?

321
00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:54.693
I mean, I thought you were overworking yourself as a guru, so I pitied you and thought about helping you.

322
00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:56.111
So what was that just now?

323
00:19:56.653 --> 00:19:58.488
Did you plan to use me?

324
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.450
Scary!

325
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.409
What?

326
00:20:02.826 --> 00:20:06.622
You become sharp-tongued as soon as things don't go exactly how you thought.

327
00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:11.293
I would've been fine even if I didn't rely on you.

328
00:20:11.418 --> 00:20:14.713
You even looked so smug when you had me meet the mayor~

329
00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:16.632
You said you weren't able to meet the mayor...

330
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:21.637
You think the mayor acknowledged me because I relied on you?

331
00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:23.555
There's no way!

332
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.599
It was decided way before all of this!

333
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:28.602
I'm sure she investigated our cult, either way.

334
00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:34.024
That's why, even if you weren't involved...

335
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:36.235
...the result would've been more or less the same.

336
00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.238
Then why did you ask me to do it?

337
00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.490
I didn't ask you to.

338
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:45.827
You did what you wanted based on your assumptions from the start.

339
00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:46.954
Assumptions?

340
00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:51.208
I didn't even say anything about quitting my guru status in the first place, did I?

341
00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.337
See? You don't get it.

342
00:20:55.462 --> 00:20:58.674
I don't even want to quit. I'm finally an idol.

343
00:20:59.174 --> 00:21:00.133
An idol?

344
00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:02.844
Being a guru is like being an idol!

345
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.431
So many beastmen worship me, praise me...

346
00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:08.809
They look for hope and dreams in me!

347
00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.519
Isn't that like being an idol?

348
00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.271
What the hell...

349
00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:15.023
Are you okay with being used as an idol by that gross grandpa?

350
00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:17.109
Besides, saying a guru is an idol...

351
00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:18.777
You haven't changed a bit, Michiru.

352
00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:26.785
When something happens right before your eyes, you jump into it without a second thought.

353
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.788
That part of you hasn't changed at all.

354
00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:31.748
Jumping in based on assumptions...

355
00:21:31.873 --> 00:21:35.210
...deciding to pity someone all by yourself...

356
00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:37.546
...and thinking about saving someone just like that...

357
00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:40.924
Isn't that just to stroke your ego?

358
00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:42.092
That's not...

359
00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:46.221
Also, Boris isn't as gross as you think.

360
00:21:46.346 --> 00:21:47.347
That's not true.

361
00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:50.058
See, you're pushing it.

362
00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:54.521
I decided to do anything to achieve my dreams.

363
00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:56.523
I'm not Nazuna right now.

364
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.943
I'm the Silver Wolf Maiden, Death Rube!

365
00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:02.904
Okay... I got it.

366
00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:04.990
That's enough then.

367
00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:05.866
However!

368
00:22:06.533 --> 00:22:11.079
I have no friend named Death-whatever!

369
00:22:11.204 --> 00:22:16.043
♪～

370
00:22:43.737 --> 00:22:48.575
～♪

371
00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:50.368
Why...?
